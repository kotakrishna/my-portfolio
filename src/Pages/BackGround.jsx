          I'm currently up-skilling as Full Stack Developer at{" "}
          <span> Masai School </span>
          building skills for the world with some awesome people. I graduated
          from <span> St.Martin's Engineering College </span> after completing
          Electrical and Electronics Engineering.

          As a software engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering
          and design â€” combining my technical knowledge with my keen eye for
          design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build
          applications that are scalable and efficient under the hood while
          providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.

          probably cycling, battling on chess.com, or crossing off another item
          on my bucket list.
