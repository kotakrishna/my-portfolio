            Freelancing isn't just a job for me; it's a lifestyle. I'm all about{" "}
            <span>#RemoteWork</span> and believe in the power of working from
            anywhere (be it a beach, a coffee shop, or my living room). For me,
            freedom trumps stressed-out growth. I aim to grow, learn, and
            innovate at my own pace, without the traditional 9-5 constraints.

            As a software engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering
            and design â€” combining my technical knowledge with my keen eye for
            design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build
            applications that are scalable and efficient under the hood while
            providing engaging, great user experiences.
